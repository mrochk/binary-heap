# Binary-Heap
Minimalist and simplest *header-only* [binary heap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_heap) implementation.

To use it, just copy-paste `binary_heap.hpp` to your project.

You can first run the example program to check that everything is working as expected by typing `make`.

*There is no error handling except a bunch of assertions, you're free to treat errors as you wish by modifying what I did.*
